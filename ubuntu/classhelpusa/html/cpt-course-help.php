                        <h2 class="pt-3">What Is A CPT Exam & Why Is It Hard For Students To Solve It On Their Own?</h2>
                        <p class="inner-paragraph">CPT means Curricular Practical Training. In CPT classes, you learn how to work while being a student in the USA. It talks about the job rules, university requirements and legal steps to work part-time or full-time. These lessons are helpful but can also be hard because many students are not familiar with U.S. job laws. The chapters have long reading or often use tough words. Some lessons are hard to remember. Group talks, online class tools as well as time limits also make it harder to manage everything.</p>
