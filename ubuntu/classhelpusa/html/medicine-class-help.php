                        <h2 class="pt-3">What Is Medicine Course Assistance? & Why Do Students Struggle With Their Online Medical Classes?</h2> 
                        <p class="inner-paragraph">Medicine is the subject that teaches us about health, sickness along with how to take care of people who are not well. It includes many different areas such as the human body, diseases, drugs, body parts and how everything works together. Many students find medicine difficult because the words are long, the lessons are deep & there is too much to read or remember in a short time.</p>
                       <p class="inner-paragraph font-size-medium blue-color"><b>Here are some reasons students find it tough:</b></p>
                       
                       <ul class="providing-solution-list">
                            <li><p class="inner-paragraph">The medicine books are full of big chapters & new words that are hard to understand. Reading everything and remembering it all takes a lot of time.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="inner-paragraph">Many words in medicine are long, hard to say or hard to spell. You have to learn what they mean, how to use them as well as how to write them in tests.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="inner-paragraph">Medicine students have many quizzes, assignments and big exams. To prepare for these, you must study a lot every day.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="inner-paragraph">You must understand how the body works, how organs are connected & what happens when someone gets sick. That can be tricky if the teacher does not explain clearlys</p></li>
                            <li><p class="inner-paragraph">Many students also feel pressure to get top marks because they want to become doctors or nurses in the future and that adds stress.</p></li>
                        </ul>
