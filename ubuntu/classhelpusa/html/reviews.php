				<p class="inner-paragraph">As an international student in the USA, I had to think about an entirely different education system with an even heavier workload. CHU made it a bit easier because they were able to help with my homework. I never once had to question if their work was accurate, or that thought even crossed my mind while I was working through the homework they helped me with. They helped me focus on learning the course information instead of stressing about all of the homework piling up. If you are in the same situation, I would recommend CHU to you as well.</p>
