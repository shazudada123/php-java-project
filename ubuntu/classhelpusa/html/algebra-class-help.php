                        <h2 class="pt-3">What Is Algebra And Why Is It Difficult For College Or University Students To Handle?</h2> 
                        <p class="inner-paragraph">Algebra is a type of math where we use numbers and letters (like x or y) to represent unknown values. It involves solving equations & finding these unknowns. For many students, Algebra can be tough for a few reasons. First, understanding variables (letters that stand for numbers) can be confusing. Word problems make it hard to turn sentences into math equations.</p>
                        <p class="inner-paragraph">Algebra also introduces new ideas, like exponents or factoring, which can feel complicated. Many problems require multiple steps, which can be easy to mix up. Lastly, students often don’t have enough time to practice. These challenges make Algebra hard, but with help, it can become easier to understand.</p>
