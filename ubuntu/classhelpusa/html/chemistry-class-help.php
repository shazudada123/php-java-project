                        <p class="inner-paragraph">Chemistry is the science that studies matter or how it changes. It includes ideas like atoms, molecules, reactions as well as how substances interact. Many students find chemistry hard because:</p>
                        <ul class="providing-solution-list">
                            <li><p class="inner-paragraph">It involves many formulas, symbols & equations.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="inner-paragraph">You need to do a lot of calculations and sometimes know advanced math.</p></li>
